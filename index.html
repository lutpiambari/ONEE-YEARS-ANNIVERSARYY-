  Meeting you was like watching the universe quietly place something perfect into my life — 
  a woman so strong, so soft, so breathtaking in ways that words can never fully hold.  
  You are beauty in its calmest form, strength wrapped in tenderness, and every moment with you 
  feels like discovering a new reason to fall deeper in love. Youre the best thing i ever have my love.
    once again i wanna say thankie for coming into my love, AWAFUU VERYY VERYY MUCHH CATHLYN PANOT❣️💋🌹
